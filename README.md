# Protein Chemistry

Protein-Chemistry is a Nextflow pipeline for extracting UniProt IDs and predicting chemical properties of proteins using Propy3. The pipeline takes input file as an argument. The input file should be a list of UniProt IDs or protein sequences in FASTA format. The output file will be a TSV file containing the protein IDs and the predicted chemical properties.

## Installation

To install Protein-Chemistry, you will need to have Nextflow, UniProt, and Propy3 installed. You can install Nextflow using the following command:

```
conda install -c nextflow nextflow
```

You can install UniProt using the following command:

```
pip install uniprot
```

You can install Propy3 using the following command:

```
pip install propy3
```

Once Nextflow, UniProt, and Propy3 are installed, you can clone the Protein-Chemistry repository and run the pipeline using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/aysanraza/protein-chemistry.git
cd protein-chemistry
nextflow run pipeline.nf
```

## Usage

To run the Protein-Chemistry pipeline, you will need to specify the input and output files on the command line. You can do this using the following arguments:

* `--input_file`: The path to the input file.
* `--output_file`: The path to the output file.

For example, to run the pipeline with the following input and output files:

* `input.txt`
* `output.tsv`

You would use the following command:


`nextflow run pipeline.nf --input_file input.txt --output_file output.tsv`


Once the pipeline has finished running, you will find the output TSV file in the directory where you executed the command.
